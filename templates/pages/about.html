        <h3 class="mt-4">The Pilot Behind the Blog</h3>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Michael Matthews, the creator of Horizon Flight Blog. My journey into the world of flight simulation began over 15 years ago when I first installed Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 on my family's computer. What started as a casual interest quickly developed into a full-blown passion that has only grown stronger over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I don't hold a real-world pilot's license (yet!), I've logged thousands of hours across various flight simulation platforms, from the classic FS2004 to X-Plane 12, DCS World, and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. I've built multiple home cockpit setups, ranging from simple desk arrangements to my current semi-immersive home cockpit with multiple displays and hardware controllers.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-4">Why I Created This Blog</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my journey, I've learned countless valuable lessons about flight simulation - from technical setup advice to virtual piloting techniques. I created Horizon Flight Blog to share this knowledge with the community and provide a platform where both newcomers and veterans can find valuable information and inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
            But beyond the technical aspects, I believe flight simulation is about something more profound - it's about the joy of flight, the wonder of seeing our world from above, and the satisfaction of mastering a complex craft. Through this blog, I hope to capture and share that sense of wonder and accomplishment.
